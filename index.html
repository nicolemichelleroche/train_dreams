        <p><h4>Now that I’m home all the time, here at 23 1/2 Walnut Street in Potsdam, New York, I have recommitted myself to documenting the trains that pass through my yard each day. This entails recording the time of day, direction (north- or south-bound), duration, notable contents, notable graffiti, and, occasionally autobiographical notes from my day.<br><br>

          This might sound tedious, obnoxious, or crazy. <br><br>

          You’re either the kind of person who wants to keep a detailed record of a train schedule, or you’re not.<br><br>

          You’re either the kind of person who wants to read another’s person’s train schedule, or you’re not.</h4></p><br><br>

          <br><h3>Notes on the Train Schedule</h3><br><br>

          <h4><b>Week 1 (March 28–April 3)—</b>I didn’t know what I was looking for yet. Data is missing or incomplete. Most importantly, I wasn’t writing down engine numbers yet. Nonetheless this first week was important for helping me to define my data set and because it helped establish the existence of particular patterns, such as time or day or daily frequency.<br><br>

          <b>Week 2 (April 4–10)—</b>Much improved. Still not writing down engine numbers. We’ll get there.<br><br>

          <b>Week 3 (April 11–17)—</b>I am finally developing eyes for this project. A standardized data set emerges this week with the addition of engine numbers. This is the first time I notice the Tuesday/Thursday “baby train” schedule (#6531).<br><br>

          <b>Week 4 (April 18–24)—</b>We were supposed to return to school this week. That isn’t happening now. The train log continues.<br><br>

          <b>Week 5 (April 25–May 1)—</b>This week, the realization that I never would have known about this baby train if I had still been teaching my regular schedule (Tue./Thurs. mornings).<br><br>

          <b>Week 6 (May 2–8)—</b>I’ve been metal detecting in the backyard. So many buried hunks of coal, rusted railroad spikes, random hunks of metal… Old railroad trash. I showed some students my train-log-in-progress in a Zoom meeting this week. The class is called “Everyday Artifacts.” What do they expect?<br><br>

          <b>Week 7 (May 9–15)—</b>This weekend I was suddenly on-the-bathroom-floor sick with vomiting, diarrhea, and a fever that lasted for two days. Get Tested, my mother and doctor said. Three nurses in gowns and face shields came to my window like Sonic car hops. “Turn your head and brace yourself against the head rest.” Deep discomfort followed, pain really… A singular experience, though the best description I can come up with is the sensation of feeling a part of your insides for the first time, simply because someone is palpating it. (In this case, the inside of my head.) Three days later, the results came back negative. Shoot—By that point, I was hoping for the antibodies.<br><br>

          <b>Week 8 (May 16–22)—</b>The semester is over and behind me. That means fewer Zoom meetings to be interrupted by my trains (I hope). It was a late spring, but now the foliage outside my window has grown to the point that I cannot see the trains passing in the middle of the night. Which means I must run through the house and onto the back porch if I have any hope of seeing those engine #s…<br><br>

          <b>Week 9 (May 23–29)—</b>We were out of town—overnight—for the first time in months. From Saturday afternoon until Monday morning. The whole time I thought about the trains I was missing. (Should I have asked a neighbor to help?)<br><br>

          <b>Week 10 (May 30–June 5)—</b>While keeping the original paper log, I accidentally wrote “Friday, June 6” (it was the 5th)—a mistake I did not correct until I started a new page in the log thirteen days later on Thursday, June 18.<br><br>

          <b>Week 11 (June 6–12)—</b>After weeks of talking about it, we finally set a date to follow the baby train. Wherever it goes when it goes south on Tue./Thur. mornings, it doesn’t go far—it’s always back within two hours. (Gouverneur? Philadelphia? It couldn’t be going all the way to Watertown…) That morning, it came two hours early, while we were having our coffee in the kitchen. We never would have caught it.<br><br>

          <b>Week 12 (June 13–19)—</b>Lee always says that if a train derailed here, we’d be fine since our house is on the inside curve. But I read that the explosion after the derailment in Lac-Mégantic had a blast zone of 0.6 miles… This week I learned from my friend, a chemistry teacher at the university, that all those of tanks full of hydrochloric acid, liquid petroleum gas, etc. aren’t the ones to worry about… it’s the crude oil.<br><br>

          <b>Week 13 (June 20–26)—</b>There has been talk of borrowing a trail cam so I never miss a train. I welcome, and fear, the data load.<br><br>

          <b>Week 13 (June 27–July 3)—</b>We spent the weekend in New Hampshire. Another black hole in the data… But a person must live. At a friend’s yard-fire across town later that same week, I scrambled to record a passing train as accurately as possible. (Is it headed north? South? When do I start the timer?) A friend at the party said, “You aren’t still writing down trains, are you?”<br><br>

          <b>Week 14 (July 4–10)—</b>#6531, the baby train, has been replaced by young upstart #2503. Fourth of July party at our friends’ new house in Canton. Also near the tracks (though not on them). A train passes, and I walk down the street to watch it with my friend and his two-and-a-half-year-old boy. I take a video, send pictures to his wife. The data is compromised. This isn’t my train. Or is it?<br><br>

          <b>Week 15 (July 11–17)—</b>On July 14, the <i>New York Times</i> publishes an article about the importance of documenting the pandemic as it happens. That "we are all field collectors now.” One woman has been recording bird sounds for weeks, and captured audio of Black Lives Matter protests in the process. “It’s become a diary of sorts,” she said.<br><br>

          We might be moving. The market is hot and we can sell this place and rent this other better house that will be ready August 1. In the country. On the Orebed Road. But (?) / And (?) there are no trains on the Orebed Road. On July 13 I decided that whatever happens, I will continue this log for 23 ½ weeks (in honor of 23 ½ Walnut). That means keeping this up until the end of August. By that point, I might finally be ready to stop.</h4>
